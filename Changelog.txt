- added contributions by Onno Zweers:
  - synctool-diff patches

- bugfix for running a single task
- options -1, --single, --diff, --ref can be given multiple times on a
  single command-line to handle multiple files
- 'synctool-config --nodename' displays my nodename
  Which comes in handy when scripting .post scripts
- dumped synctool_core for synctool_overlay, which has much cleaner code
  and supports having multiple overlay dirs, which are merged together
  in memory
- .post scripts for directories are now run _in_ that directory rather than

  dependancies over multiple directories with .post scripts
