Build RPM with help from the git-build-rpm package:
https://github.com/iovation/git-build-rpm

To build the rpm, I cd to the 'home' directory of the package,
and then:

git build-rpm --rpm-dir /home/local/lane/rpmbuild  \
    --dist .fc38 --spec-file=synctool.spec 
mv /home/local/lane/rpmbuild/SRPMS/synctool* . 

the --rpm-dir is to recover the .rpm files after building,
(they get moved to the package home directory)
and the --dist is to set the distribution name, rather than
the long, random string that is otherwise generated.
