In 'synctool terminology', a "node" is a host, a computer in a group of
computers. A group of computers is called a cluster.


First of all, synctool requires passwordless SSH from the master node to
each cluster node as root. Exactly how to do this is beyond the scope
of this document (see the SSH documentation or just google around), but
I'd like to say this about it:
 * use SSH keypairs
 * or use hostbased authentication, also for root
 * set sshd_config PermitRootLogin without-password
 * run sshd only the internal network interface to secure your system
 * in general, passwordless SSH from any cluster node to your master node
   should _not_ work/be allowed; or at least, synctool does not need this

For sites with extra tight security, it is possible to configure ssh to run
only specific (synctool) commands, or maybe you want to change the
ssh_cmd in the configuration so that it runs a different command, that
suits your security needs.

When passwordless SSH as root works, proceed to installing the software.


Edit the provided Makefile and adjust PREFIX to point to your
desired location where the symlinks to the software should reside. 
Some prefer /usr/local, others prefer /usr/local/synctool, while others
prefer /opt. Pick whatever you think is best.
The value of MASTERDIR defaults to /var/lib/synctool. This is where the 
python sources are copied, and where you should put your synctool.conf,
and your overlay directories. This directory will be synced to your nodes
with every synctool run.

On your master node, run 'make install'. This copies the commands
to the selected location and sets up symlinks for:

  synctool -> synctool_master.py
  synctool-config -> synctool_config.py
  synctool-ping -> synctool_ping.py
  dsh-ping -> synctool_ping.py
  synctool-ssh -> synctool_ssh.py
  dsh -> synctool_ssh.py
  synctool-scp -> synctool_scp.py
  dcp -> synctool_scp.py
  synctool-aggr -> synctool_aggr.py

It also creates the master repository under /var/lib/synctool/
Copy the synctool.conf.example to /var/lib/synctool/synctool.conf
and edit it, adjusting it as needed.

synctool.conf describes what your cluster looks like; what nodes
have what roles, and how synctool can contact them.
Think a bit about what role each machine has. There is no need to
go into great depth right now; you can always adjust the configuration
later.

  node n1 interface:machine-n01

The nodename is the 'synctool name that the node has'. It is in general the
short hostname of the host, but in fact it can be anything you like. The
nodename has nothing to do with hostnames or DNS entries.
The interface specifies how synctool can contact the node; this can be an
IP address or a DNS name of the host you wish to contact. In clusters, there
is often a management network interface -- configure that interface name
here.

It is good practice to label your master node as 'master' or 'install'.

  node n1 master interface:machine-n01

Now n1 responds to the groups 'n1' and 'master'.

Some people don't like managing the master node itself with synctool.
While it _is_ possible and perfectly alright to do this, some like to
exclude the master node by default:

  ignore_node n1


You have to list each and every host.
In the contrib/ directory, there is a script that uses nmap ping with
which you can scan your management network and quickly turn it into
a synctool configuration. This makes life a bit easier.


Nodes can be in as many different groups as you like. You can split
long lines of node definitions by ending them with a backslash:

  node n101 workernode debian plasma mathworks solar \
            fsmounted backup interface:if0-n101

Mind however, that in practice, synctool repositories are generally
easiest maintained with as few groups as possible.

If you have many nodes that all share the same long list of groups,
the groups may be abbreviated by defining a compound group. This
compound group must be defined before defining the nodes:

    group wn workernode debian plasma mathworks solar \
             fsmounted backup

    node 101 wn interface:if0-n101


After filling a couple of nodes in synctool.conf, try the command
'dsh-ping' to see if can see that the nodes are 'up'. If they are,
try 'dsh hostname', 'dsh uptime', or 'dsh date'.
If you correctly set up passwordless SSH, dsh should run the commands
on every node without problems or needed manual intervention.
It is important that this works, before proceeding.

NB. Some (mostly IBM) systems already have a 'dsh' command. In synctool,
    'dsh' is a symbolic link to synctool-ssh
    The same goes for 'dcp', which is a symlink to synctool-scp


Now that you have a rough setup on the master node, try running
synctool to a single node:

    synctool -n anodename

If you get 'command not found', add /opt/synctool/sbin to your PATH.
By default, the full path to the command is:

    /opt/synctool/sbin/synctool -n anodename

There should be some output about 'DRY RUN'. This means that synctool
is now working. You can try running synctool across all nodes:

    synctool

Check that every node responds. You can also use 'dsh' to check that
passwordless SSH to every node is setup correctly:

    dsh uptime

or

	dsh hostname

When synctool to every node works, the basic setup is done and
you can start filling your repository with useful files.


What happened to 'make client_install'?
It is no longer needed. The master node now automatically updates
synctool on the client nodes. The binaries needed for this are
located under /var/lib/synctool/sbin/, and this directory gets
synced to the nodes, as long as it is the masterdir specified in 
synctool.conf.
